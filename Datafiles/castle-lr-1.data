Character	-	down-character.png	-5.0	-3.0		Oh! hey, you should keep back, the castle gentry recently had these new (and verrry expensive) glass ceilings repaired, wouldn't want you walking arond, then CRASH! 100-foot fall.;We wern't even here until a cloak bloak came rushing through the last set of tiles, now we're on guard, and we put up these gates to keep people off portions of the roof.;Hey, on second though, you look a lot like the description of that guy...

Character	-	down-character.png	-3.0	-3.0		Halt! You cannot pass, as we, the Fine Arts Protection Squadron, have sworn on our honor to defend the newly installed stained glass ceilings of Castle Lorem Ipsum.;Look at you, if the likes of you were to somehow get past me and my men, let alone break the recently-blown glass panes, I might as well hang up my armour in shame and let you pass.;Wait! Don't get any funny ideas, I saw that look!	  Fine Arts Protection Soldier
